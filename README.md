# E-commerce Project - Milestone 1

This document outlines the progress made in Milestone 1 of our e-commerce project. This milestone focused on setting up the basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and creating a foundational order page.

## MERN Stack Demonstration

This milestone successfully demonstrated the integration of the MERN stack:

*   **M - MongoDB:** Used as the database to store application data.
*   **E - Express.js:** Implemented as the API, acting as an intermediary between the client (React) and the server (Node.js).
*   **R - React:** Chosen as the client-side framework for building the user interface of the application.
*   **N - Node.js:** Used as the runtime environment for executing the Express.js server.

## Key Accomplishments

*   **Order Page:** A basic order page was created, laying the groundwork for future order management features.

### What We Did
In this milestone, we focused on creating a clean and responsive login page. It's straightforward yet effective, giving users a smooth experience.

### Features
- **User-Friendly Design:** The login page looks great and works well on any screen size.
- **Interactive Inputs:** Users can enter their username/email and password easily.
- **Client-Side Validation:** We added basic validation to make sure inputs are on point.

### Tools We Used
- **React:** To build the interface.
- **CSS:** For all the styling magic and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** To handle interactivity and validation.
