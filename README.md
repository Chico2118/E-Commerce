# E-commerce Project - Milestone 1

This document outlines the progress made in Milestone 1 of our e-commerce project. This milestone focused on setting up the basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and creating a foundational order page.

## MERN Stack Demonstration

This milestone successfully demonstrated the integration of the MERN stack:

*   **M - MongoDB:** Used as the database to store application data.
*   **E - Express.js:** Implemented as the API, acting as an intermediary between the client (React) and the server (Node.js).
*   **R - React:** Chosen as the client-side framework for building the user interface of the application.
*   **N - Node.js:** Used as the runtime environment for executing the Express.js server.

## Key Accomplishments

*   **Order Page:** A basic order page was created, laying the groundwork for future order management features.

## ðŸ”‘ Milestone 2: A Simple, Responsive Login Page

### What We Did
In this milestone, we focused on creating a clean and responsive login page. It's straightforward yet effective, giving users a smooth experience.

### Features
- **User-Friendly Design:** The login page looks great and works well on any screen size.
- **Interactive Inputs:** Users can enter their username/email and password easily.
- **Client-Side Validation:** We added basic validation to make sure inputs are on point.

### Tools We Used
- **React:** To build the interface.
- **CSS:** For all the styling magic and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** To handle interactivity and validation.

# Milestone 3: Project Overview

## Overview
In this milestone, we focused on setting up the basic backend configurations necessary for our project. This involved learning and applying key backend development concepts and tools.

## Key Learnings

1. **Express.js**
   - Learned how to set up and use Express.js to create a robust and scalable backend server.
   - Implemented routes and middleware to manage API requests effectively.

2. **MongoDB Integration**
   - Learned how to use MongoDB as our database solution.
   - Established a seamless connection between MongoDB and our server using the Mongoose library.

3. **Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
   - Gained an understanding of how to use JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
   - Implemented token-based authentication for protected routes.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Mastered techniques to handle errors effectively, ensuring the backend runs smoothly and errors are logged or communicated clearly.

## Features Implemented
- Basic server setup with Express.js.
- Database connection using MongoDB and Mongoose.
- User authentication using JWT.
- Comprehensive error handling for improved debugging and user experience.

  Milestone 4

This project demonstrates creating a MongoDB schema, integrating file uploads using multer, hashing passwords with bcrypt, parsing request bodies with body-parser, and securing routes with JWT-based authentication.

Features

MongoDB Schema: Define and manage MongoDB collections using Mongoose.

File Uploads: Upload and store files using multer.

Password Hashing: Secure user passwords using bcrypt.

Body Parsing: Parse incoming request bodies using body-parser.

JWT Authentication: Secure project routes and manage authentication tokens.

Technologies Used

Node.js: Backend runtime environment.

Express: Web framework for building APIs.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.

Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB.

Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.

Bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.

Body-Parser: Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data.

jsonwebtoken: Library for creating and verifying JWT tokens.
