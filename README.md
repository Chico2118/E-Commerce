## Milestone 1: MERN Stack Demonstration

This milestone focused on setting up the basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and creating a foundational order page.

### MERN Stack Components:

- **R - React:** Chosen as the client-side framework for building the user interface.
- **N - Node.js:** Used as the runtime environment for executing the Express.js server.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **Order Page:** A basic order page was created, laying the groundwork for future order management features.
